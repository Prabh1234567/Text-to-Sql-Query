# Text-to-Sql-Query
Here’s a description you can use for your project:
"Natural Language to SQL Converter"

This project allows users to input plain English descriptions of the data they want to retrieve from a database. The system interprets these natural language inputs and converts them into accurate SQL queries. Once the query is generated, it can be executed against the database to fetch the required results.

For example:

Input: “Get the names of all customers from Udaipur who placed an order in July”

Output SQL:
SELECT name FROM customers WHERE city = 'Udaipur' AND MONTH(order_date) = 7;

This tool bridges the gap between non-technical users and relational databases, making data access more intuitive and efficient.
